# Project Title: Housing Price Prediction üè°

## Overview

This project aims to predict housing prices based on various features using a linear regression model. It demonstrates fundamental machine learning concepts, including data loading, exploratory data analysis (EDA), data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation, using the California Housing dataset.

## Key Features

- **Data Source:** California Housing dataset (available via `scikit-learn`).
- **Model Used:** Linear Regression, a foundational algorithm for predicting continuous values.
- **Libraries:** `pandas` for data manipulation, `scikit-learn` for machine learning models and utilities, and `matplotlib` and `seaborn` for data visualization.
- **Key Concepts Demonstrated:**
    - **Regression:** Predicting a continuous output variable.
    - **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Understanding data distributions and relationships.
    - **Data Preprocessing:** Handling data types and preparing features for modeling.
    - **Train-Test Split:** Dividing data for robust model evaluation.
    - **Model Training:** Fitting a linear regression model to the training data.
    - **Model Evaluation:** Using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared to assess performance.

## Setup and Installation üöÄ

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
    
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/housing-price-prediction.git
    cd housing-price-prediction
    
    ```
    
    *(Replace `your-username` with your actual GitHub username)*
    
2. **Create and activate a virtual environment:**
    
    ```
    python -m venv venv
    # On macOS/Linux
    source venv/bin/activate
    # On Windows
    venv\Scripts\activate
    
    ```
    
3. **Install dependencies:**
    
    ```
    pip install pandas scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn jupyter
    
    ```
    
4. **Launch Jupyter Notebook:**
    
    ```
    jupyter notebook
    
    ```
    
    This will open the Jupyter interface in your browser.
    

## Usage üìà

Open the `housing_price_predictor.ipynb` file in Jupyter Notebook. You can run cells sequentially to follow the entire machine learning pipeline, from data loading and exploration to model training and evaluation.

## Results and Insights (Example)

The model, after training on the California Housing dataset, achieved a Mean Squared Error (MSE) of approximately `0.52` and an R-squared (R2) score of about `0.64` on the test set. This indicates that the linear regression model can explain around 64% of the variance in housing prices. While a simple linear model, it serves as a strong baseline and demonstrates the fundamental steps of a regression task.

## Future Improvements (Optional)

- Experiment with more advanced regression models (e.g., Ridge, Lasso, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting).
- Perform more in-depth feature engineering to create new, more informative features.
- Explore different visualization techniques for better data insights.
- Implement cross-validation for more robust model evaluation.
